v1.0
[New] Updated for the new google reader layout.

v0.95
[New] Added starred unread counter script. (Note: only works for default account if you have multiple accounts.)
[New] Added a hide likes option that hides the '# people liked this' and the 'like' button.
[Fix] Changed 'wide screen reader' script because the old one was giving problems.
[Fix] Removed 'Article Focus' script, as it's probably more trouble then it's worth, if it works.
